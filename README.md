Game-Of-Life
============

Conway's cellular automata.

Notes:

- LINUX COMPILE: gcc -o <compiled_code_name> <code_name>.cpp -lGL -lglut -lGLU -lpthread -lpthread -lstdc++

- If compiling the program on Linux include <GL/glut.h> as the library

- If compiling the program on Mac include <GLUT/glut.h> as the library

- Once the program has been ran, press any keyboard to proceess the next generation on the grid.

- If you desire to change the dimensions of the grid then these must be a power of 2 or a number that is multiple of 10. For optimal visualization both X and Y should match.
